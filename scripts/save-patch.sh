#!/bin/bash
# Save selected changes from work/ as a numbered patch with the required
# header, and append it to the series. A patch is a working file until
# committed to the project repository.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/save-patch.sh <NNNN-short-name> \
#     --problem "..." --solution "..." --scope "..." \
#     [--status candidate|local-only|submitted|accepted]
#
# Semantics and safety:
#   - The local base is verified first: work HEAD must equal the
#     reconstructed (manifest pin + complete series) tree. A stale base
#     (pin changed in the manifest, series edited, amended commits) makes
#     this refuse — otherwise the saved diff would not reproduce.
#   - What gets saved: everything staged in work/ (git add / git rm there
#     first). Binary changes are saved as git binary patches.
#   - Base-Commit: the pinned commit from upstreams.json, not the local
#     work HEAD — patches chain on the pin, series defines the order.
#   - Requires: the last patch currently in the series, or none.
#   - Ordering (central contract): patch file and series entry are written
#     BEFORE the local baseline advances; a failure in either rolls both
#     back, leaving work/ untouched.
